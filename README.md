# NodemailerApp 
The nodemailer is a module that enables an easy and automated way of sending messages from apps with Node.js. Here are some features I noted while working with nodemailer: 
- Before we can send an email, we will need a transporter. We can create one with nodemailer by simply calling nodemailer.createTarget({servie,auth}). service specifies the provider you are using, in my case its Gmail, and since we would be connecting to a server, nodemailer needs to authenticate whoever is trying to connect. That is why we would pass in some auth data. For oauth2 which I used, we would set the type to "Oath2", pass in our oauth credentials and also a refresh token we generated.
- Now we can send mails by simple calling the sendMail() function on our created transporter. The sendMail takes in two params, one is the message options which contains info about sender,receiver(s) and message content, and then a callback function which would return an err object if message failed or data object containing messageId, envelope which is an object containing message content, accepted which is an array of recipients email addresses that were accepted by server, rejected which is an array of recipients addresses that were rejected by the server, pending which is an array of recipient email addresses that were temporarily rejected by server and response which is a string that includes the last SMTP response from the server.
